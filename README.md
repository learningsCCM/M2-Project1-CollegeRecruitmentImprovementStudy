README for Project 1 - College Recruitment Improvement Study

## Purpose of Study
The Computing Entry Course Survey is given to students pursuing computing majors and the Computer Literacy Course Entry Survey is given to students pursuing non-computing majors. 

The purpose of the study is to understand interests and demographics of the responding students to in turn be able to identify needs, gaps, etc. in technology offerings and recruitment strategies.

Some of the questions that the study seeks to understand include:
* How many students from each different class responded to the survey?
* What are the gender percentages?
* What is the racial/ethnic diversity? For those students selecting more than one race/ethnicity, assign multi-racial to their category.
* What is the age distribution for the survey?
